<p>Hi! I am Sergio Marconi, PhD student in Interdisciplinary Ecology at
  University of Florida. I am interested in understanding why we live
  in the Nature we live in: what are the processes that shape trees communities and
  ecosystems structure? How do realized structures at landscape affect continental and
  global functions of forests? I use machine learning methods to recognize scale dependant patters,
  while I build statistical and deterministic hierarchical models to try answering such questions.
</p>
  </p>Last but not least, in what's left of my free time I like to explore some
  figurative arts: give a look to <strong>My Figurative Projects<strong>
